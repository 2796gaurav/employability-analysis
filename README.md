# Employability analysis

In today’s competitive world, it’s getting difficult to get a job of suitable profile. It may be because
of automation, recession or maybe the students themselves are not knowledgeable enough for
the work expected from a particular profile. It can also be that students aren’t aware of what the
requirements are to work in a particular domain. Our system has been created to help students
in all such scenarios. From a few assessment tests, it can provide you with an employability
factor which shows how much employable you are for a particular domain. It
can also suggest jobs which suit your current overall profile. This system can be used by students
to assess themselves, by placement cells to measure employability of their student, and also by
companies to check employability potential of prospective employees.
